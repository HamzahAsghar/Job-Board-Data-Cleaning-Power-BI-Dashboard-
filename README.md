# Job-Board-Data-Cleaning-Power-BI-Dashboard-

# Project Overview
This project involved cleaning and analyzing messy job board data files provided by a client. Each dataset (March & April) contained over 150,000 rows and 20+ columns of raw, unstructured information. My goal was to transform this data into a structured format and build insightful, interactive Power BI dashboards.

# Tasks Completed
# 1. Country Extraction from Descriptions
The client required the country name to be extracted from unstructured job descriptions in each row.
I implemented this using a VLOOKUP/XLOOKUP-based approach in Excel to match known country names from a reference table.

# 2. Product Category Extraction
Similarly, I extracted the product category from each description using VLOOKUP/XLOOKUP with a predefined category reference list.

# 3. Power BI Dashboard Creation
Created separate interactive dashboards for March and April datasets in Power BI that include:

Total Unit Price

Total Effective Price

Total Quantity Sold

Total PayG Price

# 4. Additional Interactive Elements
To enhance data exploration, I also added:

Slicers for Country and Category

Filters by Date, Region and other relevant fields

Visualizations to show distribution and trends
